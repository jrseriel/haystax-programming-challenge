# Solution

## 1. `Overview`
1. Enter the email, validation will fail if nothing is entered, or not in the correct format
2. Enter the password, validation will fail only if nothing is entered
3. Enter the phone number, validation will fail if nothing is entered or if non-numbers, andor not 10 digits are entered,
4. After all validation is successful, it will load the registered page, stating that registration was successful and thanking the email address(As per the prompt, a name was not to be inputted).

## 2. `Build/Compile/Run`
As this is an .html file, any web browser will be able to display [question9.html](../question9/question9.html) and [question10.html](../question10/question10.html)

This is very self explanatory.

## 3. `Output`
If the validation is successful on submit, it will load [registered.html[(../question9/registered.html)
